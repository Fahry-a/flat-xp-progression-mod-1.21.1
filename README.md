### ðŸ“© Download **Flat XP Progression** on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/flat-xp-progression)

Minecraft treats XP like an RPG, with the amount for each level increasing exponentially, yet uses it as a form of currency. This mod changes XP to be a consistent **flat rate**, reducing late-game grinding.

This mod is only needed server-side for multiplayer and client-side for singleplayer. On startup, a properties file is created that lets you set the XP required to level up (default is 50, making level 30 with this mod require about the same XP as level 30 in vanilla).

forking to add version 1.21.1(work prety well)
